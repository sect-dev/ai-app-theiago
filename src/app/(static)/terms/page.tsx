	<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
	<p>Date of Revision: 14 February 2025
Welcome to theaigo.com
These Terms of Service (the “TOS”) set forth the legally binding terms for your use of theaigo.com and/or any of our online channels, platforms, products or services, including all content contained therein (&quot;Services&quot;). Services include any affiliated website to which you may be redirected from theaigo.com.
The Services are owned and operated by New Verve Limited, duly incorporated in the United Kingdom, having its address at 86-90 Paul Street, London, England, EC2A 4NE and registered with the Companies House under the number C107181.
By accessing and/or using the Services you agree to be bound by these TOS. You understand and agree that your access and/or use of the Services is acceptance of these TOS and of all other policies published on https://theaigo.com/legal-information and updated from time to time (“Policies”). If you do not agree with these TOS or our Policies, please cease using or accessing our Services.
Our Services are intended and made available for personal, non-commercial use only. You agree not to use the Services for any commercial, illegal, or unauthorized purpose.
For purposes of the TOS, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services.
All conversations between users and AI Companions on the Services are entirely fictional and should be treated as such. The AI Companions are artificial intelligence characters designed to simulate human-like interactions, but they do not possess genuine emotions, intentions, or the ability to fulfill promises in the real world. Any elements within the conversations that may resemble reality, such as offers of real-life meetings or promises of tangible outcomes, are entirely fake and should not be taken seriously. We do not assume responsibility for any confusion or misunderstandings in this regard. Users are encouraged to keep in mind that the AI Companions exist solely within the digital realm of the platform, and any expectations or beliefs beyond that realm are not supported or endorsed by New Verve Limited.
</p>

<h2>1. General</h2>
<p>The Services are an online chat application that uses artificial intelligence (“AI”) algorithms to generate virtual and fictional characters (“AI Companions”), with whom you can chat and exchange messages. The Services also include, but are not necessarily limited to, other media such as images, videos and voice notes. Parts of the Services may require you to create a user account and/or become a paid subscriber.
You can either choose an AI character who you wish to talk to, or generate your own by choosing their physical and personality characteristics via our technology/algorithms. You can then start a conversation with your selected character(s).
</p>

<h3>1.1 Account</h3>

You agree to, from time to time as necessary, update any information associated with your account (including but not limited to, your email, payment information, subscriptions or other supplemental information as the case may be) so that it remains current, accurate and correct at all times. You also agree to protect the confidentiality of your user account and password, and to prohibit others from accessing your account.
You are fully responsible for all activities occurring under your login credentials and account. Your account is non-transferrable. You cannot sell, lend, or otherwise share it with any other person, for commercial purposes or free of charge.
Any violation of these TOS may cause your user account to fall out of good standing and we may cancel your user account at our sole discretion.
