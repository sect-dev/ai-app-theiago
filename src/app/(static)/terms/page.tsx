      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>
        Date of Revision: 14 February 2025 Welcome to theaigo.com These Terms of
        Service (the “TOS”) set forth the legally binding terms for your use of
        theaigo.com and/or any of our online channels, platforms, products or
        services, including all content contained therein
        (&quot;Services&quot;). Services include any affiliated website to which
        you may be redirected from theaigo.com. The Services are owned and
        operated by New Verve Limited, duly incorporated in the United Kingdom,
        having its address at 86-90 Paul Street, London, England, EC2A 4NE and
        registered with the Companies House under the number C107181. By
        accessing and/or using the Services you agree to be bound by these TOS.
        You understand and agree that your access and/or use of the Services is
        acceptance of these TOS and of all other policies published on
        https://theaigo.com/legal-information and updated from time to time
        (“Policies”). If you do not agree with these TOS or our Policies, please
        cease using or accessing our Services. Our Services are intended and
        made available for personal, non-commercial use only. You agree not to
        use the Services for any commercial, illegal, or unauthorized purpose.
        For purposes of the TOS, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the
        Services. All conversations between users and AI Companions on the
        Services are entirely fictional and should be treated as such. The AI
        Companions are artificial intelligence characters designed to simulate
        human-like interactions, but they do not possess genuine emotions,
        intentions, or the ability to fulfill promises in the real world. Any
        elements within the conversations that may resemble reality, such as
        offers of real-life meetings or promises of tangible outcomes, are
        entirely fake and should not be taken seriously. We do not assume
        responsibility for any confusion or misunderstandings in this regard.
        Users are encouraged to keep in mind that the AI Companions exist solely
        within the digital realm of the platform, and any expectations or
        beliefs beyond that realm are not supported or endorsed by New Verve
        Limited.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">1. General</h2>
      <p>
        The Services are an online chat application that uses artificial
        intelligence (“AI”) algorithms to generate virtual and fictional
        characters (“AI Companions”), with whom you can chat and exchange
        messages. The Services also include, but are not necessarily limited to,
        other media such as images, videos and voice notes. Parts of the
        Services may require you to create a user account and/or become a paid
        subscriber. You can either choose an AI character who you wish to talk
        to, or generate your own by choosing their physical and personality
        characteristics via our technology/algorithms. You can then start a
        conversation with your selected character(s).
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">1.1 Account</h3>
      <p>
        Parts of our Services may require you to create a user account with an
        email and password or other available login method (the “Protected
        Areas”). When registering and/or accessing Protected Areas, you agree to
        do so only using your login credentials. By using the Services, you
        represent and warrant that all information you submit to create a user
        account is true and correct, you have full rights to submit such
        information. You agree to, from time to time as necessary, update any
        information associated with your account (including but not limited to,
        your email, payment information, subscriptions or other supplemental
        information as the case may be) so that it remains current, accurate and
        correct at all times. You also agree to protect the confidentiality of
        your user account and password, and to prohibit others from accessing
        your account. You are fully responsible for all activities occurring
        under your login credentials and account. Your account is
        non-transferrable. You cannot sell, lend, or otherwise share it with any
        other person, for commercial purposes or free of charge. Any violation
        of these TOS may cause your user account to fall out of good standing
        and we may cancel your user account at our sole discretion. Meanwhile,
        we reserve the right to terminate or restrict your account, or otherwise
        revoke access to the Services, at any time if we, in our sole
        discretion, have reason to believe or suspect that you have violated the
        terms of these TOS or other Policies. You agree that we will not be
        liable to you or any third party for, without limitation, any denial of
        use of the Services, any change of costs for third party services, fees,
        or other obligations arising from suspension or termination of your

        should be made pursuant to the terms presented at the time of the
        purchase. You are responsible for payment of all fees, charges and taxes
        (as applicable) related to the transaction. We are not responsible for
        any costs and disclaim any liability arising from your use of a
        third-party distribution platform that is not indicated or recognized by
        us.

        should not disclose sensitive personal information, including, for
        example, financial details, addresses, contact information, or
        passwords. Users are solely responsible for protecting their personal
        information and should be aware of potential risks associated with
        transmitting information online. We encourage users to report any
        suspicious or inappropriate behavior encountered on the platform, as we
        are committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all
        users.

        algorithms and machine learning. We do not endorse or take

      <p>
        While conversations between users and AI Companions are generally
        confidential, we have implemented content moderation controls based on
        our proprietary LLM technology to ensure compliance with our TOS,
        Community Guidelines, and other Policies. If our moderation controls
        detect anything that violates our TOS or Policies, we may manually
        review the flagged content and/or other content associated with the
        account and take appropriate action. This may include removing content,
        terminating the user&apos;s account or reporting the content to
        appropriate authorities. See also Section 5.5 below. Additionally, our
        content moderation controls may moderate or alter your request before an
        output is generated, for example, if your request contains or seeks
        prohibited content. These measures are implemented to maintain a
        respectful and secure environment for all users. We strive to strike a
        balance between privacy and community standards, and we appreciate your
        understanding and cooperation in adhering to our guidelines. We reserve
        the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any user
        content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates these
        provisions. If you believe there has been a violation of these TOS,
        please contact us via email at contact@newverve.co, or via the “Contact
        Us” area in the Services.

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">5.5 Prohibited Content Reporting</h3>
      <p>

        moderation and removal controls, we report known CSAM to the National
        Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or other local authorities as
        appropriate.

        cannot be transferred to different users or accounts. Subscriptions are
        set to renew automatically at the end of each subscription period,
        extending for the same duration as the original contract term. The
        payment will be processed automatically on the first day of the renewed
        period. Autorenewal can be cancelled at any time in your settings (see

      <p>
        All details about your subscription, including start date, end date and
        type of subscription plan can be found under My Profile / Settings
        within your account. You have the flexibility to cancel your
        subscription at any time by going to Settings / Unsubscribe within your
        account. If you choose to cancel, your subscription will remain active
        until the end of the current billing period, and you will not be charged
        for the subsequent period.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">10.2 Access upon cancellation</h3>
      <p>
        Upon the cancellation of your subscription, you will retain access to
        your account and all associated features until the end of the current
        billing period. At the conclusion of this billing period: 1. Platform
        Access: Your access will be restricted to the free version of the
        platform. You will no longer have access to premium features and content
        that are exclusive to paid subscriptions. 2. Token Usage: Any remaining
        tokens in your account will expire and become unusable. Please make sure

        will not carry over or be refunded after your subscription ends. You may
        resubscribe to our platform at any time to regain access to premium
        features and content. However, any tokens from previously cancelled
        subscriptions that were not used within the relevant billing period
        cannot be carried over to a new subscription. Each subscription period
        is treated independently, and tokens must be used within their
        respective billing periods. If a subscription or a token purchase is
        refunded, the subscription is deemed immediately cancelled. All access
        to premium features and remaining tokens will be revoked at the time of
        refund processing. If a chargeback request is filed, the subscription is
        immediately cancelled. All access to premium features and remaining
        tokens will be revoked at the time the chargeback request is filed.
