        depending upon the purpose for and context in which that information was
        provided. We generally transfer data to the categories of recipients or
        in connection with Business Purposes, as described below.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Vendors and Service Providers</h4>
      <p>
        In connection with our general business operations, service
        improvements, enablement of certain features, and other lawful business
        interests, we may share Personal Information with vendors, service
        providers, and subprocessors who provide certain services to us or
        process data on our behalf. For example, we use third party hosting
        providers to host our Service or Content, and we may disclose
        information as part of our own internal operations, such as security
        operations, internal research, etc.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Corporate Events</h4>
      <p>
        Your Personal Information may be disclosed to a third party in the event
        that we consider or go through a business transition, such as a merger,
        acquisition, liquidation, or sale of all or a portion of our assets. For
        example, Personal Information may be part of the assets transferred, or
        may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the
        due diligence process for a potential transaction.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Affiliates</h4>
      <p>
        To streamline certain business operations and develop services that
        better meet the interests and needs of our customers, we may share your
        Personal Information with any of our current or future affiliated
        entities, subsidiaries, and parent companies.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Legal Disclosures</h4>
      <p>
        In limited circumstances, we may, without notice or your consent, access
        and disclose your Personal Information, our correspondence with you, and
        any other information that we may have about you to the extent we
        believe such disclosure is legally required, to prevent or respond to a
        crime, to investigate violations of our Terms of Use or Community
        Guidelines, or in the interests of us or any person. We may, in our sole
        discretion (but without any obligation), object to the disclosure of
        your Personal Information to such parties.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">9. YOUR RIGHTS & CHOICES</h2>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Your Rights</h3>
      <p>
        Applicable law may grant you rights in your Personal Information. These
        rights vary based on your location and state/country of residence and
        may be limited by or subject to our own rights in your Personal
        Information. You may submit requests to exercise rights you may have by
        contacting us at aigoai@gmail.com.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note - we are able to fulfill rights requests regarding Personal
        Information that we control or use. We may not have access to or control
        over Personal Information controlled by third parties. Please contact
        the third party directly to exercise your rights in third party-
        controlled information.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Verification Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        All rights requests we receive directly must be verified to ensure that
        the individual making the request is authorized to make that request, to
        reduce fraud, and to ensure the security of your Personal Information.
        For example, we may require that you verify that you have access to the
        email on file in order to verify your identity. If an agent is
        submitting the request on your behalf, we reserve the right to validate
        the agent&apos;s authority to act on your behalf.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Your Choices</h3>
      <p>
        You may have the following choices regarding the Personal Information we
        use, to the extent required under applicable law:
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Changing Your Information</h4>
      <p>To change your information, please contact us at aigoai@gmail.com.</p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Closing Your Account</h4>
      <p>
        If the email account associated with your email address is not active,
        we may remove it from our system without notice. To close your account,
        please email us at aigoai@gmail.com.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Consent</h4>
      <p>
        If you consent to our use of Personal Information, you may withdraw your
        consent at any time. You may be required to close your account to
        withdraw consent where your consent is necessary to perform essential
        aspects of our Service.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Email Marketing</h4>
      <p>
        You have the choice to opt-out of or withdraw your consent to email
        marketing communications. You may exercise your choice via the links in
        our communications.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Cookies & Similar Technologies</h4>
      <p>
        If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies and
        similar technologies, you can manage/deny cookies and certain similar
        technologies using your browser&apos;s settings menu. You must opt out
        of the use of some third party services directly via the third party.
        For example, to opt-out of Google&apos;s analytic and marketing
        services, visit Google Analytics Terms of use, the Google Privacy
        Policy, or Google Analytics Opt-out.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-bold">Do-Not-Track</h4>
      <p>
        Your browser or device may offer you a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; option,
        which allows you to signal to operators of websites, web applications,
        mobile applications, and services (including behavioral advertising
        services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your
        online activities over time and/or across different websites or
        applications. The Service does not support Do Not Track requests at this
        time, which means that we or our analytics providers or other third
        parties with which we work may collect information about your online
        activity both during and after your use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">10. SECURITY</h2>
      <p>
        We implement and maintain commercially reasonable security measures to
        secure your Personal Information from unauthorized use. While we
        endeavor to protect our Service and your Personal Information against
        unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure, we cannot
        guarantee that any information, during transmission or while stored on
        our systems, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">11. DATA RETENTION</h2>
      <p>
        We retain Personal Information for so long as it is reasonably necessary
        to achieve the relevant purposes described in this Policy, or for so
        long as is required by law. What is necessary may vary depending on the
        context and purpose of use. We generally consider the following factors
        when we determine how long to retain data (without limitation):
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
        <li>Retention periods established under applicable law;</li>
        <li>Industry best practices;</li>
        <li>
          Whether the purpose of use is reasonably likely to justify further
          use;
        </li>
        <li>Risks to individual privacy in continued use;</li>
        <li>Applicable data protection impact assessments;</li>
        <li>IT systems design considerations/limitations; and</li>
        <li>
          The costs associated with continued use, retention, and deletion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mt-4">
        We will review retention periods periodically and may pseudonymized or
        anonymize data held for longer periods.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">
        12. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES OR APPLICATIONS
      </h2>
      <p>
        This Policy applies only to the Service. The Service may contain links
        to other websites or apps or may forward users to other websites or apps
        that we may not own or operate and to which this Policy does not apply.
        The links from the Service do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed
        these websites or apps. The policies and procedures we describe here do
        not apply to these websites or apps. We neither can control nor are
        responsible for the privacy practices or content of these websites or

        and China. If you are located outside the U.S. or China, your Personal
        Information may be used in the U.S. or China. The U.S. or China may not

        other countries.
